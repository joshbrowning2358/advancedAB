Deliverables:
- R Package
    1. Function for simulating AB test
        - daily impressions
        - click rate
        - estimated lift
        - days
        - tests per day
        - MAB traffic adjustment
        - daily variability
        - A, B, C, ...
    2. Function comparing two test strategies
        - Number of simulations
        - Output: power, days to decide, false positive rate
    3. Function generating shiny code
    4. Vignette
- Paper detailing the 3 new strategies:
    1. Sequential Testing
        a. Value only when power is high and decisions want to be made quickly, otherwise traditional is best.
    2. Adjusting for daily variability
    3. Multi-armed bandit
- Table providing best approach, via many simulations
- 40 consulting hours to answer questions/help with implementation
